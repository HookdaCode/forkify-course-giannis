# Forkify App

A recipe search application built as part of the **"JavaScript: From Zero to Expert"** course by Jonas Schmedtmann on Udemy. This project utilizes the **Forkify API** to fetch recipes and allows users to manage their favorite dishes interactively.

## 🍽️ Features
- **Recipe Search**: Find recipes by ingredient or dish name using the Forkify API.
- **Detailed Recipe View**: Displays cooking instructions, ingredients, and serving sizes.
- **Adjustable Servings**: Dynamically update ingredient quantities based on desired servings.
- **Bookmarking**: Save favorite recipes for quick access.
- **Pagination**: Browse through multiple pages of search results efficiently.
- **Add Your Own Recipe**: Submit custom recipes to the app (stored in local storage).
- **Persisted Data**: Bookmarked recipes remain available even after refreshing the page.

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
- **MVC Architecture** for code organization
- Fetch API & Asynchronous JavaScript (Promises, Async/Await)
- Event Delegation & DOM Manipulation
- Local Storage for data persistence
- Parcel.js for module bundling
- Modern UI with CSS
